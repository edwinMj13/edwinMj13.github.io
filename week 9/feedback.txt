This week was to complete my database integrations and it is all over. Currently Iâ€™m working on the functionalities in the project which is playing music. The seekbar is not functioning properly with my likes. I finished the favorites screen, the playlist screen, the all songs screen, the delete, adding to playlist and adding to favorites these are the things that are finished. The unfinished ones are the edit in the all songs screen. Then the recent screen then the seekbar when a song is played. But it will finish soon.
