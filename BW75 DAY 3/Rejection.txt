Subject: Regarding Offer Letter

Greetings Sir/Madam,

I hope you are doing well.

I really appreciate the way every one engaged with me during the interview. And I'm thankfull for the Offer that you had for me. Any Developer who have a good basics will love to join in your company.

Actually, I had attended an Interview with another company and they offered me 6 LPA and your offer was 4.5 LPA. Their Interview situations were much like your company's.

I had verbally accepted your job offer.  With the Offer letter I had of the other company I'm respectfully rejecting your offer. Good luck in finding the perfect candidate for your company. I hope you will understand the situation.

Thanks & Regards,
Edwin Baby,
