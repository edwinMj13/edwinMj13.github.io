One of the weeks assignment was to learn about local storage, hive shared preferences, sqflite etc… 
I’ve done my assignment with shared preferences in week 4, it was a login page. This week I did a login page with sqflite, 
Its student record can edit and update, we can create new record also.. This week’s personal development workout was about
to write a review about the movie  “shawshank redemption” and to write a review about the book “Discipline Equals Freedom” 
by Jocko Willink. The movie deals about hope, courage, intelligence etc… and the book is all about the strength of descipline.

Then the Second task is to do an app with sqlite database. Insert student details such as name, age, place, martialstatus and an image. .
To do this app I used flutter_sqflite package. Did operations such as create, insert, update, delete and also did search. 
The first page of app shows the list of saved students then we can add another student by clicking the add button in the appbar.
We can edit delete the students details, and these operations is also available for search.
