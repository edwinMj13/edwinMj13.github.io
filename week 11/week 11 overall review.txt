This week 11, has been very hard for me. I had to work on shuffle all the 3 week but the correct implementation has not yet finished. This week ive added menu option in  recently added songs screen. then edit delete option in playlist screen. Then the image flickering issue is still not solved. There was an issue in deleting last song of the playlist it is solved. Apart from this the only issues that are remaining is the shuffle feature in musicplayer screen and image flickering when an image of the song shows up..
