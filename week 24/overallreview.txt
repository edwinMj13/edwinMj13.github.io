The week 24 was very productive. I implement razorpay, finished setting up cart,finished listing order in user side(app section). In the admin panel i had to list the orders then update the status of the order. then when clicking on one of the order it will be showing the order details . Then i need to finish the home screen of the user side of the project need to finish the edit profile . And we can see the order details in the app section also...
