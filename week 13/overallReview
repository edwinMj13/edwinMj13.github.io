Its been a wonderfull week for me. I extended it one time then it got cancelled the second time. I got so many errors there are some i just didnt get hold of. but ive been working on them.
Im now trying to host the website in github and not in the firebase. Then i changed the local database to hive as sqflite didnt have support in web.
