Week 25 was a wonderfull week to remember, had many downfall still couldn't get up from that , couldn't host the app in amazon Appstore. They stated that the app is stuck when clicking google signup button. I submitted the app 3 tinme but the same problem thay stated. athey even sent me a video of them testing and sent a log. So from the log its saying that most probable cause might be the the google sign in, so amazon have its own plugin to enable google signin, i understood that part yesterday and didn't get to finish it because of the error that im getting.Everything else is finished.
